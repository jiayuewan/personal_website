I'm a fourth year PhD student in the School of [Operations Research and Information Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Peter Frazier](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/). Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate in Mathematics and Physics at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu) and earned my Master's degree in Management Science & Engineering at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu).

My research interests lie in

COVID modeling
