I'm a fourth year PhD student in [Operations Research](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Peter Frazier](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/). Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate in Mathematics and Physics at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu) and earned my Master's degree in Management Science & Engineering at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and sequential experimental design. My current research focuses on designing novel Bayesian optimization algorithms for drug discovery and materials design, focused on preventing ice growth on airplane wings.

I have also been working with a fabulous [COVID mathematical modeling team](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/covid-19-modeling/) to model the spread of COVID-19 since pandemic began. Leveraging techniques from stochastic modeling, simulation and optimization, our model directly guided Cornell's president and provost on reopening and intervention decisions, and has influenced policies at many other US universities. Our work has appeared in news media such as [ABC news](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/video/cornell-university-exclusive-contained-covid-19-73163035), the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-cornell-will-reopen-in-the-fall-11593535516), the [Asahi Shimbun](https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASP1R3F85P1NULFA00T.html) and [more](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/cornells-covid-19-modeling-media-coverage/).
